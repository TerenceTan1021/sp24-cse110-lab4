**Question 1**
<hr>

line 9 will produce the output _20_, since add is true it will run the if function, and add the two numbers together

<br>

**Question 2**
<hr>

line 13 will produce the output _20_ because the var result can be used within the function

**Question 3**
<hr>

line 9 will produce the output _20_ the same as question 1

**Question 4**
<hr>

now line 13 will produce an error, due to result being labeled with _let_. let variables are only avaliable withing the first opening brackets before and the scope stops after the next closing bracket

**Question 5**
<hr>

line 9 will produce an error, a variable being assigned with a _const_ cannot be changed

**Question 6**
<hr>

line 13 will also produce the same output, because you have already attempted to change the _const_ value.
